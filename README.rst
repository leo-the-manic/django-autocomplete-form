django-autocomplete-form
------------------------
This is a bit of a niche project. If you are displaying two forms on the same 
page, for two different but related models, this app will let you designate 
certain fields on a subform as 'search' fields; if the user searches and
finds a match they like, the rest of the fields for the subform will be 
filled. Through this mechanism, users can either link their submissions to
pre-existing dependency objects or create new dependency objects along with
their new 'main' object.

More plain English description and documentation in the future! (hopefully)
